# Ablayer Source

Huh, where is the source, you'd say?

[The source](index.md) is contained within the markdown files you see here.
Why? To keep the narrative behind the software and features as close
to the implementation as possible.

As an added benefits, features that require changes on multiple locations within the source can be remain close together, as demonstrated in [ideas.md](ideas.md)

The code inside these markdown files is extracted using the [walkthrough compiler](https://github.com/j-angnoe/code-walkthrough-compiler)
